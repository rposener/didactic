# didactic

A repo of how to accomplish modern development goals with Web Components

## getting started

So let me explain what this is... 

It's a recipe that contains a few classes and a couple helper functions.  It covers all the core ingredients you'll find in most frameworks or libraries today.  I call it didactic because everything here is very open and clear with simple instructions of how to accomplish modern development goals without any framework or library.

The reason I've created this is to show just how easy it is to attain similar benefits to what frameworks provide.  Everything here is just some syntactic sugar to create simpler patterns over native browser APIs.  

The benefits I see in that are:
*  Easy to optimize
*  No new languages/approaches
*  No magic (Virtual-DOM diffing or otherwise)

Frameworks are great and can boost consistency and simplicity for large teams and new developers but they also come with a set of things you have to do a certain way.  The idea here is to teach you how to meet all the same goals yourself using nothing but the built-in browser features.  

Even if you are a framework or library user I would encourage you to have a look through this to understand just how simple it is to solve the same problems that your fravorite frameworks and libaries are solving for with a little bit of time and just a few lines of code.
